# BreakOut

Recreation of the popular retro game "BreakOut" using turtle module in Python

Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc.[7] and released on May 13, 1976.
In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them.
Breakout begins with eight rows of bricks, with two rows each of a different color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn.
